        I am a sculptor and designer who manipulates scale and form to create objects with their own
        identities and personalities. My objects and furniture are whimsical, narrative, and
        functional. Through my work I subvert the notion that a functional object is required to
        serve a user, instead prioritizing the autonomy of the object itself. Creating objects of a
        non-normative scale disrupts the presumption of a design world that revolves around human
        utility, and questions how much of a role functionality should play in the design process of
        an art object. Combining traditional and contemporary techniques, I create slowly with the
        intention of producing one of a kind objects.
